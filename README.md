# Project-Creator

This is my first attempt to create a plugin

My problem is that I'm learning processing in my college and there's no
plugging to create the folder structure necessary to run processing sketch,
so I made this simple plugin that you can create some kind of defaults for a project
inside neovim


## Requirements

[Nui.nvim](https://github.com/munifTanjim/nui.nvim) - for floating windows.
