# Project-Creator

This is my first attempt to create a plugin

My problem is that i'm learning processing in my college and there's no
plugging to create the folder structure necessary to run processing sketch,
so i made this simple plugin that you can create some kind of defaults for a project
inside neovim


## Requirements

Nui.nvim - for floating windows.
